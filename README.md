## Snake Game in Python

This project is a classic snake game implementation in Python using the Turtle library.

**Project Specifications:**

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** Turtle
* **Platform:** Windows, Linux, macOS
* **Requirements:**
    * Python 3
    * Turtle library
    * pip (package manager)

**Features:**

* Single-player mode
* User-controlled snake movement (arrow keys)
* Randomly appearing food items
* Increasing difficulty as score increases
* Scoreboard
* Collision detection with walls and self
* Game over screen
* Restart option


**Gameplay:**

* Use the arrow keys to move the snake (up, down, left, right).
* Eat the food items to increase your score and make the snake grow longer.
* Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body.
* The game ends when the snake hits anything.
* Press the space key to restart the game.

**Code Structure:**

* The project is divided into several modules:
    * `main.py`: Main game logic and engine.
    * `snake.py`: Snake object definition and movement.
    * `scoreboard.py`: Scoreboard object and display.
    * `food.py`: Food object definition and behavior.
* Each module contains well-documented code with comments and docstrings.

**Further Development:**

* Add multiple difficulty levels.
* Implement sound effects and background music.
* Create a menu screen with options.
* Implement high score tracking.
* Add power-ups and obstacles.
* Implement a graphical user interface with Turtle graphics.
